            The provided image is an Acoustic Guitar primarily made of wood. The major parts you need to know to get started are:
            * **Tuning Pegs:** These pegs located on the head of the guitar can be rotated and are used to tune the strings.

            * **Strings:** You cant play the Guitar without it unfortunately.

            * **Frets:** These are the partitions you see on the neck of the guitar. Pressing a string on a fret is
            used to produce a note.

            * **Sound Hole:** This amplifies the sound played on the Guitar.

            * **Bridge:** The Bridge holds the strings together on one end while the Neck does the same on the other end.

            * **Pick Guard:** Its saves the wood from getting scratched while strumming the strings.

        # Treat Your Guitar Right
        Now that you are an aspiring Guitarist, you should know how to handle your guitar the correct way. As a
        beginner or if you have a new guitar, you will tend to treat your guitar kindly. But as time passes, your
        guitar is likely to end up in a corner somewhere in the house and gather dust. For the
        longevity of your instrument, you would need to remember the below:

        * Whenever you pick up the guitar, always hold the guitar where the Neck meets the Body.
        * If weren't aware, wood tends to bend and the Guitar Neck is the most likely to do so. If you are not planning
        to play for a while, loosen your strings.
        * While at rest, keep your guitar upright or lay it down on its back.
        * Clean the guitar once a month or every quarter with a dry cloth. This is not mandatory if you don't have
        any dust allergies or asthma.

        The above should suffice for your guitar to last for quite a few years. There is no need to go overboard and
        clean and nurture your guitar everyday. If you have bought your very first guitar, remember you would feel
        happier if you outgrow it with your skills and buy a better guitar. So focus more on improving your skills.
